# In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. __I want to come with you to Alderaan.__ *There's nothing for me here now.* I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

## I call it luck.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like存uicide. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

1. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
2. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
3. You mean it controls your actions?

### Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like存uicide.

* Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
* Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
* But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like存uicide. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I call it luck. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

What?! I call it luck. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Red Five standing by. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like存uicide. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

You mean it controls your actions? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers
